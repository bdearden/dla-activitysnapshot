In a homogeneous system, what is the relationship between the number of variables, the number of <q>leading ones</q> in the most reduced form of the coefficient matrix, and the number of parameters required to solve the system? What pattern of leading ones in a completely reduced coefficient matrix tells you that the corresponding homogeneous system has a single, unique solution?

	where the constants of each equation are not specified. For what values of the unknown constants <m>b_1,b_2,b_3</m> is this system consistent?
	</p><p>
	To answer this question, row reduce the associated augmented matrix (below) until you are at a point where you can determine conditions on the constants <m>b_1,b_2,b_3</m> that ensures the system is consistent.
