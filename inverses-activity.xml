    The number one is important in algebra, it lets us do things like

    <p>
  	In the preamble to <xref ref="activity-inverses-identity-matrix" />, there were two ingredients necessary to make the algebra work:
  	<ul>
      <li>there is a special number <m>1</m> so that <m>1a=a</m> for all numbers <m>a</m>; and</li>
      <li>for a nonzero number like <m>5</m>, there is a <term>multiplicative inverse</term> <m>1/5</m> so that <m>(1/5)\cdot 5 = 1</m>.</li>
    </ul>
    Multiplicative inverses are very useful in algebra, so we would also like to have them in matrix algebra.
    <ol label="(a)">
      <li>
      <p>
      Consider <me>A = \left[\begin{array}{rr}0\amp-1\\1\amp2\end{array}\right]</me>.
      Can you determine <me>B = \begin{bmatrix}a \amp b\\c \amp d\end{bmatrix}</me> so that <m>BA = I</m>?
  		If so, check that <m>AB = I</m> also.
      </p>
      <aside><p>
        Don't just guess at matrix <m>B</m>, use the definition of <term>matrix equality</term> applied to <m>BA</m> and <m>I</m> to set up equations and try to solve for unknown entries <m>a,b,c,d</m>.

    The previous activity demonstrates that some square matrices have multiplicative inverses (<ie /> are <term>invertible</term><idx><h>invertible</h></idx>) and some do not (called <term>singular</term><idx><h>singular</h></idx> in this case). If square matrix <m>A</m> is invertible, write <m>\inv{A}</m> for its inverse. (But <em>never</em> write <m>1/A</m>!) This inverse is <em>defined</em> by its relationship to <m>A</m> and <m>I</m>: <m>\inv{A}</m> is the square matrix of the same size as <m>A</m> so that both <m>A\inv{A} = I</m> and <m>\inv{A}A = I</m> are true.
    </p>
    <aside><p>
    Do you understand why we must assert that <em>both</em> <m>A\inv{A} = I</m> and <m>\inv{A}A = I</m> are true in defining the inverse <m>\inv{A}</m>, not just one? Maybe look back at
    <xref ref="activity-matrix-ops-matrix-mult-order-matters" />.
