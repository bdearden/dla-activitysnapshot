	<introduction><p>
		Complete the following tasks for each of the three types of elementary row operations, one at a time:

			<li> multiply a row by a nonzero constant;</li>
			<li> add a multiple of one row to another.</li>

	<task xml:id="activity-elem-matrices-invert-elem-mystery-op"><p>
		Suppose someone has performed a single elementary row operation on a matrix, but they have only given you the <em>result</em> of this computation (as well as telling you <em>exactly</em> what row operation they performed). How can you recover the original matrix the person started with?
	</p></task>
	<task><p>
		Determine a general rule for the inverse of an elementary matrix of the type you are currently considering. You should be able to answer this directly, <em>without</em> using the method you developed in
		<xref ref="activity-elem-matrices-invert-method" />,
		by instead considering your answer to the previous step of this activity.
