  <prelude>
  <p> For <m>m\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>, from <xref ref="activity-col-row-null-space-colspan-motivation" /> it appears that the subspace of <m>\R^m</m> obtained by taking the span of the columns of <m>A</m> is important when considering consistency of the system <m>A\uvec{x} = \uvec{b}</m>. Call this subspace the
  <term>column space of <m>A</m></term><idx><h>column</h><h>space</h></idx><idx><h>matrix</h><h>column space</h></idx>.
  Let's explore how to reduce our spanning set (the columns of <m>A</m>) down to a basis. For this task we'll need a fact about how multiplication by a matrix affects the linear independence of column vectors.

If vectors <m>E\uvec{v}_1,E\uvec{v}_2,\dotsc,E\uvec{v}_\ell</m> are linearly independent in <m>\R^m</m>, then so too <m>\uvec{v}_1,\uvec{v}_2,\dotsc,\uvec{v}_\ell</m> are linearly independent in <m>\R^n</m>.

		<li> Build a linearly independent set of column vectors from <m>B</m> by working from left to right, and either including or discarding each column based on whether it is linearly independent from the vectors you have already accumulated. (You should, of course, begin by <q>including</q> the first column.)	What do you notice about your final set of linearly independent columns, relative to the reduced form of <m>B</m>? </li>

    Now suppose <m>A</m> is a matrix that can be reduced to <m>B</m> by <em>two</em> elementary operations. Then there are elementary matrices <m>E_1,E_2</m> so that <m>B = E_2E_1A</m>. Similarly to part (b), from <m>B = E_2(E_1A)</m>, decide which columns of <m>E_1A</m> are linearly independent. Then from the proposition stated above and
