  <biography xml:id="author-bio-JS">
    <p>
    Jeremy Sylvestre is Associate Professor of Mathematics at the University of Alberta's Augustana Campus.

  <preface xml:id="preface">

    <p> The purpose of this book is to serve as supporting material for a fairly typical course in <em>Linear Algebra</em> using a discovery-based pedagogical approach. </p>

    <p>
    Each chapter is organized into sections titled <em>Activities</em>, <em>Terminology and notation</em>, <em>Concepts</em>, <em>Examples</em>, and <em>Theory</em> (though some chapters have additional <em>Motivation</em> and/or <em>More examples</em> sections).
    </p><p>
    The purpose for employing this uniform sectioning scheme is to give the student a uniform flow to encountering each new collection of topics:
    <dl>
      <li><title><em>Activities</em></title>
      <p> initial encounter through discovery- and problem-solving-based activities; </p>
      </li>
      <li><title><em>Terminology and notation</em></title>
      <p> introduction of the communication tools necessary to begin a more sophisticated conversation about the new topics; </p>
      </li>
      <li><title><em>Concepts</em></title>
      <p> fuller discussion of the new topics, grounded in reflections on the questions and results of the <em>Activities</em> section; </p>
      </li>
      <li><title><em>Examples</em></title>
      <p> computational examples to assist students with the procedural tasks related to the new topics, as well as additional examples that serve to illustrate certain concepts; and </p>
      </li>
      <li><title><em>Theory</em></title>
      <p> a more formal and general description of the concepts, with proofs. </p>
      </li>
    </dl>
    Traditional textbooks usually intersperse terminology, concepts, examples, and theory in a linear narrative, and relegate <q>activities</q> to the <em>Exercises</em> section at the end of the chapter. By organizing the flow of learning in the above-described manner, it is hoped that the process of encountering and re-encountering (and <em>re</em>-encountering) the topics in different modes <mdash /> discovery, reflection and discussion, examples, and theory <mdash /> and at increasing levels of sophistication will lead to deeper learning.
